1. **Token**, your bot token, use user token (not a bot token). How to get? youtube.
2. **sendOnStart**, it means the message automatically send after the bot start.
3. **prefix**, to execute the bot command, [what command?](#command).
4. **repeatMsg**, to enable repeat feature, it means the message will keep spamming every x second.
5. **repeatMsgDelay**, explained at number 4.
6. **commandExecutor**, userID, optional, it means another user to execute the bot command, keep it empty so only the user that used to self-bot can use the command.
7. **msg**, the message, if you set more than 1, it will be randomized. Keep on eye about formating, don't end up with ",".
8. **target**, for the channel target. the format is ["guildID1", "channelID1"], ["guildID2", "channelID2"], etc... how to get? google.


## <a id="command"></a>Bot Command
Who can execute the command?
- The account that you use for self-botting
- The user that you put at config file
What command i can use?
1. `!!run` to run the bot, it used if you turn off "sendOnStart" at config, or if you turn off "repeatMsg".
2. `!!undo` to undo last sent message. But if you enabling repeatMsg, let say sending 4 message per 10 second, it only undo the last 4 message.
3. `!!undoall` same as number 2, but to undo every single message that you sent since you start the bot, if you close the bot console, it reset.
4. `!!repeatoff` to disable the repeat task but keep the bot online, incase you do something wrong about the message and want to undo it.
